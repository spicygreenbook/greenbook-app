## How To Contribute Code
The app is built with [Expo](https://expo.io/) + [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and is hosted/deployed on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) (formerly now.sh)

## What do I need to know to contribute code?
**Absolutely Critical**: JavaScript

**Helps a lot**: Git/GitHub, Expo.io, React/React Native, NextJS, CSS, HTML, Understanding fetching JSON data from an API

## How to get started coding on this app
```sh
    # clone the repo
    git clone git@github.com:spicygreenbook/greenbook-app.git

    # change your directory into the greenbook repo
    cd greenbook-app

    # install node modules
    yarn install

    # install expo
    npm install expo-cli --global

    # run expo.io
    expo start

    # run nextjs (for web)
    # this should make http://localhost:3000 available in your web browser
    npx next dev

```

## Workflow
  Use the expo.io app that opens on your localhost as well as an android and ios device to test everything you develop on both android and ios so that you do not get too far into development without properly supporting each device.

  Use your web browser and check both mobile and desktop sized views to ensure the responsive web app works on all device sizes.

  When necessary, is the isWeb flag to determine when to use web compatible components and methods or mobile device options.
